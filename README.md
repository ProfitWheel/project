# Candidate Projects

This directory holds two self-contained mini projects you can share with candidates. Each folder contains setup instructions, starter code, and the prompts you can send along.

* [`investigative_planned_task_runner`](investigative_planned_task_runner/README.md) – Hands-on coding task that exercises working in an existing FastAPI codebase.
* [`explain_maven_to_pm`](explain_maven_to_pm/README.md) – Reverse-engineering and communication exercise based on a read-only orchestrator.
